# Banking RAG System - Complete Implementation Summary

## 📋 Project Overview

I've created a comprehensive **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** specifically designed for banking and financial services Q&A. This system demonstrates the complete pipeline from document embedding to intelligent response generation.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
User Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Document Retrieval → Context Augmentation → LLM Response
     ↓            ↓           ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓
"Loan info" → [1536-dim] → FAISS Index → Top-3 Documents → RAG Prompt → "Here are the loan requirements..."
```
