## Sample RAG Flow: Personal Loan Query

### Step 1: User Query
```
Query: "What are the requirements for getting a personal loan?"
```

### Step 2: Query Embedding
```python
# Convert query to 1536-dimensional vector
query_embedding = [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] # 1536 values
```

### Step 3: Vector Search Results
```json
{
  "retrieved_documents": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "title": "Personal Loan Requirements",
      "category": "loans",
      "similarity_score": 0.89,
      "content": "Personal loan requirements include: minimum age of 21 years, maximum age of 65 years at loan maturity, minimum monthly income of $3,000, employment history of at least 2 years, good credit score (minimum 650), debt-to-income ratio below 40%, valid identification documents, proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns), and bank statements for the last 6 months. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $100,000 with terms from 12 to 84 months. Interest rates vary based on creditworthiness, typically ranging from 5.99% to 24.99% APR."
    },
    {
      "rank": 2, 
      "title": "Credit Card Application Process",
      "category": "credit",
      "similarity_score": 0.76,
      "content": "Credit card application process: complete online application with personal information, employment details, and financial information. Required documents include valid government-issued ID, Social Security number, proof of income, and employment verification. Processing time is typically 7-10 business days. Approval factors include credit score (minimum 600 for basic cards, 700+ for premium cards), income verification, debt-to-income ratio, and credit history length."
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "title": "Interest Rates and Fee Structure", 
      "category": "rates",
      "similarity_score": 0.71,
      "content": "Current interest rates: savings accounts 0.50%-2.50% APY, money market accounts 1.00%-3.00% APY, CDs 1.50%-4.50% APY based on term length. Loan rates: personal loans 5.99%-24.99% APR, auto loans 3.49%-15.99% APR, mortgages 6.25%-8.75% APR.

system_prompt = """You are a knowledgeable banking assistant. Use the provided context 
to answer customer questions accurately and helpfully. Include specific requirements, 
rates, and processes. If information is not in the context, say so clearly."""

context = """
Document: Personal Loan Requirements

↓
Static Response: "See our loan requirements page"
↓
Generic answer with no context
```

### RAG System
```
Query: "What are loan requirements?"
↓
Semantic understanding: Vector embedding captures intent
↓  
Contextual retrieval: Most relevant documents based on meaning
↓
Dynamic generation: Personalized response with specific details
↓
Comprehensive answer with exact requirements, rates, and next steps
```

## Advanced RAG Techniques Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Document Synthesis
The system combines information from multiple sources:
- **Primary**: Personal Loan Requirements (89% relevance)
- **Secondary**: Credit Application Process (76% relevance)  
- **Supporting**: Interest Rates and Fees (71% relevance)

### 2. Category-Aware Retrieval
Documents are categorized for better organization:
```python
categories = {
    "loans": ["personal loans", "mortgages", "auto loans"],
    "accounts": ["savings", "checking", "money market"],
    "credit": ["credit cards", "credit lines"],
    "investments": ["IRAs", "brokerage", "mutual funds"],
    "security": ["mobile banking", "fraud protection"],
    "business": ["business banking", "commercial loans"],
    "regulations": ["compliance", "federal laws"],
    "rates": ["interest rates", "fee structures"],
    "support": ["customer service", "contact channels"]
}
```

### 3. Confidence Scoring
Each retrieval includes similarity scores:
- **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Exact match, use directly
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Good match, include with context
- **Low Confidence (0.4-0.6)**: Partial match, use cautiously
- **Very Low (<0.4)**: Poor match, suggest human assistance

### 4. Source Attribution
Every answer includes source information:
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on our lending policies...",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Personal Loan Requirements",
      "category": "loans", 
      "relevance_score": 0.89,
      "source": "lending_policies.pdf"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

## Banking-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Financial Terminology Handling
```python
financial_synonyms = {
    "APR": ["annual percentage rate", "interest rate", "loan rate"],
    "principal": ["loan amount", "borrowed amount"],
    "collateral": ["security", "asset backing"],
    "underwriting": ["loan approval", "risk assessment"],
    "amortization": ["payment schedule", "loan terms"]
}
```

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
```python
compliance_checks = {
    "TILA": "Truth in Lending Act disclosures required",
    "FCRA": "Fair Credit Reporting Act compliance",
    "ECOA": "Equal Credit Opportunity Act adherence",
    "BSA": "Bank Secrecy Act requirements"
}
```

### 3. Privacy Protection
```python
def mask_sensitive_info(text):
    """Mask PII in responses"""
    # Mask SSN patterns
    text = re.sub(r'\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}', 'XXX-XX-XXXX', text)
    # Mask account numbers
    text = re.sub(r'\d{10,}', 'XXXXXXXXXX', text)
    return text
```

class BankingChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rag_system = BankingRAGSystem()
        self.conversation_history = []
    
    def handle_message(self, message):
        # Add conversation context
        enhanced_query = self.add_context(message)
        
        # Get RAG response
        result = self.rag_system.answer_question(enhanced_query)
        
        # Store in history
        self.conversation_history.append({
            'user': message,
            'assistant': result['answer']
        })
        
        return result
```

### 3. Voice Assistant Integration
```python
def process_voice_query(audio_file):
    # Speech to text
    query = speech_to_text(audio_file)
    
    # RAG processing
    result = rag_system.answer_question(query)
    
    # Text to speech
    audio_response = text_to_speech(result['answer'])
    
    return {
        'text_response': result['answer'],
        'audio_response': audio_response,
        'sources': result['sources']
    }
```

This comprehensive RAG system demonstrates how to build intelligent, context-aware Q&A systems for banking and financial services, combining the power of semantic search with large language models to provide accurate, helpful responses to customer inquiries.
